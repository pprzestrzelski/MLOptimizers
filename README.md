# Machine Learning Optimizers
This project was created as part of my engineer thesis. It aims on examine some selected optimization approaches on an example of the travelling salesman problem (TSP).
The project currently includes following algorithms:
* brute force
* simulated annealing (SA)
* particle swarm optimization (PSO)

## Acknowledgments
The project and some of its solutions were inspired by the following github contributors:
* chncyhn
* deap
* payoung
* and an author of [mnemstudio](http://mnemstudio.org/particle-swarm-tsp-example-1.htm)
